# EL-Scoreboard
This contains the code used to create a DarkRP scoreboard within the game Garry's mod that was developed a long time ago for community called ELGCommunity that has since closed. The website can still be found [here](https://www.metallicgloss.com/projects/elgcommunity/ "ELGCommunity")

This scoreboard is designed for the community name, so modification would be required to change the name and logo present within the interface. If you wish to adjust the code and use this on your own server, or copy to help learn Lua, feel free!
